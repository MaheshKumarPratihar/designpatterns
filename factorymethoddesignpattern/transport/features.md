### Features of Factory Method Design Pattern
- **Encapsulation of Object Creation**: Clients don’t know how objects are created.
- **Loose Coupling**: Reduces dependency between client and concrete classes.
- **Scalability**: New product types can be introduced without altering client code.
- **Reusability**: Common creation logic can be reused across factories.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple product families with minimal changes.
- **Testability**: Easy to use mock factories for unit testing
