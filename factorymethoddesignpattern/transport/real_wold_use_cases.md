### Real World Use Cases
- **Web Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)**
  Browsers use factorymethoddesignpattern methods to create different types of plugins or page renderers based on content type (e.g., PDF, HTML, Flash). This allows flexible and extensible handling of various media.
- **Android OS (Activity Instantiation)**
  In Android, activities are often created using factorymethoddesignpattern methods internally to manage lifecycle and resource setup. Developers override methods like onCreate() while the system handles object creation.
- **Payment Gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)**
  E-commerce platforms use factorymethoddesignpattern methods to create different payment processors. Based on user selection, the factorymethoddesignpattern returns an instance of the correct payment service without changing client logic.
- **Game Development (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine)**
  Games use factorymethoddesignpattern methods to spawn enemies, items, or NPCs dynamically based on game level or environment. This decouples object creation from the game logic and enables easy scalability.
